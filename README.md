# ESP-32-LED-On-Off-Using-Webserver

This project is inspired by [Random Nerd Tutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-web-server-arduino-ide/) and expands upon it by adding two additional LEDs to control through the web interface.

## Project Overview

This project uses the ESP32 to create a web server that allows users to control four LEDs in real time from any device connected to the network. 

## Features
- Control four LEDs individually via a web interface
- Simple, responsive design for mobile and desktop devices
- Real-time LED status updates

## Components
- **ESP32**
- **4 LEDs(Red, Green, Blue, White)**
- **Resistors(100 ohms)** for LEDs
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**

## Getting Started
